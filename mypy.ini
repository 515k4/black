# Unfortunately tomli has deprecated strings and changed the API type
# annotations to bytes all while strings still work. We still use strings
# since it's unclear whether this will last (depends on how much the
# TOML people like bare CR as a newline sequence I suppose). Anyway,
# some versions of tomli still specify str as the type so mypy complains
# that the type: ignore is unnecessary. Gosh I wish I wasn't telling
# this story.
